    <h2>Bryant Has Season's Best Shooting Night in Loss</h2>
   <p>Twenty games into the season, Kobe Bryant finally hit 50 percent from the field, but even his slick shooting couldn’t stop Toronto from a 102-93 victory and its first season series win over the Lakers in franchise history.
Bryant dropped 21 points (8-of-16), including 15 in the second half. He also did plenty of damage with the rest of his game early on, finishing with eight rebounds and four assists.
When told he had at last hit half his shots, he responded with a grin, laugh and “Finally.”<p>
“Tonight I was able to trust my legs a little bit more and get to the mid-range,” said Bryant, who had been shooting 29.6 percent this year. “Get more to the pull-ups and those elbow sweet spots.” But Toronto — led by Kyle Lowry’s 27 points and Terrence Ross’ season-high 21 — used a big fourth quarter to pull past L.A. (3-18). The Lakers used a 13-2 third-quarter run to tie the game at 71 heading into the final period. But the Raptors (13-9) scored 11 straight points midway through the frame to bury the purple and gold. During the fourth, Toronto shot 10-of-16 from the field, while L.A. went just 8-of-21. The Lakers had just 14 assists to 15 turnovers, while Toronto had 18 dimes to only seven

      <img src="_images/kb.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="This month's contest">
      <p>Born in 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Kobe Bryant spent his early years in Italy and joined the NBA straight out of high school. A dominant scorer, Bryant won five NBA championships and the 2008 MVP Award with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although later seasons were marred by injuries, he surpassed Michael Jordan for third place on the NBA all-time scoring list in December 2014. The following year, he announced his plan to retire after the 2015-16 NBA season.<span class="enter"><a href="#" title="enter our contest">Enter</a></span></p>
